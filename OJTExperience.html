      </p>

      <p> 
        <h2> Having Self-Confidence </h2> 
           In my role as a Tech Support intern, I needed to confidently communicate with customers and provide solutions to their problems. I demonstrated self-assurance 
           in my knowledge and abilities, which helped instill trust and credibility with customers.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        <h2>  Possessing Appropriate Social Skills </h2>
         Interacting with customers and colleagues required effective communication and interpersonal skills. I listened actively to customers' concerns,

      </p>
    
      <p>
        <h2>  Being a Team Player </h2>
           Collaboration was key in resolving complex technical issues and achieving departmental goals. I actively contributed to team discussions, shared knowledge 
           and insights, and supported colleagues to ensure collective success.
      </p>

      <p> 
        <h2>  Being Punctual and Efficient </h2> 
           Timeliness and efficiency were crucial in meeting customer expectations and service level agreements. I prioritized tasks effectively, managed my 
           time efficiently, and consistently met deadlines to deliver prompt and effective solutions. 
      </p>
    
      <p>
        <h2> Being Self-Directed </h2>

           I demonstrated initiative and self-motivation in seeking opportunities for learning and growth.
      </p>

      <p> 
        <h2>  Possessing a Positive Work Attitude </h2> 
            Maintaining a positive attitude was essential in navigating challenging situations and fostering a supportive work environment. 
            I approached tasks with enthusiasm, remained resilient in the face of setbacks, and inspired positivity among team members.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        <h2> Being Well-Groomed </h2>
            While the focus of my role was primarily on technical support, presenting a professional appearance was still important in representing the company positively 
            to customers. I ensured that I dressed appropriately and maintained a neat and tidy appearance during interactions with customers.
      </p>

      <p>  
        <h2> Being Cooperative </h2>
            Collaboration and cooperation were essential in achieving shared goals and delivering exceptional customer service. I actively participated in team meetings, 
            contributed ideas, and collaborated with colleagues to address customer needs effectively.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        <h2> Being Self-Motivated </h2>
            In a fast-paced environment, self-motivation was key to staying focused and productive. I set personal goals, sought out opportunities for improvement, 
            and consistently strived to exceed expectations in my role.
      </p>

      <p> 
        <h2>  Demonstrating Good Time Management </h2> 
            Effective time management was critical in juggling multiple tasks and priorities. I utilized organizational tools, such as calendars and task lists, 
            to prioritize tasks, allocate time efficiently, and ensure timely completion of assignments.

        Through my internship at AWESOME CX as a Tech Support intern, I applied and developed competencies relevant to a
         BSIT course, including responsibility, self-confidence, social skills, honesty, integrity, adaptability, teamwork, 
         punctuality, efficiency, self-direction, positive attitude, and problem-solving. These experiences involved learning,

          <h2> What do you do daily in the OJT establishment? How does it help in improving your skills in your course? </h2>
          Engaging in tech support and monitoring during the graveyard shift, followed by auditing and asset tagging in the morning shift, provides practical application of 
          theoretical knowledge from my BSIT course. These experiences enhance technical skills, problem-solving abilities, time management, attention to detail, and documentation skills. 
          Overall, they contribute to a well-rounded skill set essential for success in the IT field.

          <h2>Describe scenarios/situations and problems encountered during your work and how you handle them? </h2> 
          Encountering a duplicated IP address issue with Unit1 led to efforts to identify and rectify the problem. Despite instructions from the Senior IT, the duplicate IP address couldn't be found. 
          Instead, the team discovered more units with duplicated IP addresses, indicating a broader network issue. This experience underscored the complexity of network management and the importance 
          of proactive measures to prevent such conflicts in the future. It highlighted the need for thorough network documentation, diligent troubleshooting, and effective collaboration within the IT team.

          My professional experience at AWESOME CX has been characterized by positive and collaborative relationships with co-OJTs, employees, and supervisors. Interactions with fellow interns have been supportive, 
          while engagement with employees has provided valuable insights into company culture and industry practices. Supervisors have offered clear guidance and mentorship, fostering my learning and growth. Overall, 
          these relationships have contributed to a positive and enriching internship experience.
